Check-in with Riley re: Project 4

What we have so far:
- Working API connection and querying functions
- Working webscraping capabilities (these are slow)
- 1000 randomly sampled ZIP codes
- Yelp API data related to 1000 random zips incl
    - Number of each $ category ($, $$, $$$, $$$$)
    - Number of reviews within each category
    - results for Restaurants, SHopping, Local Services

- IRS Tax Data for All US ZIP codes
- Metrics for each ZIP to estimate "Affluence"
    - Adjusted Gross Income
    - Property tax paid
    - Pension tax paid
    - Real Estate tax paid
    - # of filers -> creates a per-filing Affluence Metric
    
Models:
- Standardized Linear Regression
    Features:
    - # of each $ multiplied by # of reviews
    - latitude/longitude
    - Results are poor
- Target variable:
    - Log of Affluence value for each ZIP, better than non-log result
    
Ideas:
- Create two new models
    - New York City
    - Small State(s)
        - RI/CT/DE
- Incorporate categories and subcategories of business
    i.e. Mexican cuisine, laundromat instead of Restaurant, Local Service
    
- Incorporate neighboring ZIP values 
    - Include query results for "best match" ZIPs as additional features
    
- Broaden search arguments
    - Convert string "neighborhood" queries into combination of relevant ZIPs
    ! each neighborhood also needs its own per-filing metric
