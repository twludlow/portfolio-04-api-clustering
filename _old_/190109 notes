Combined Yelp and IRS data to create X and y for train/test split

Models Run:
    Linear Regression, SVR
    Standard Scaler
    Results - awful, ranging -1.3(!) to best of 0.05 (R^2/cross-val)

Ideas:
    Narrow scope to metro areas
    Data contains lots of 0-values
    
    Combine categories into single total columns (i.e. total $, total $$,...)
    Multiply $ by # reviews as polynomial feature
    
Next Steps:
    Goals:
        - Pull remaining USA yelp data, combine with existing models to compare 
        - Start smaller/medium models
